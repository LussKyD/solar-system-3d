# 🪐 Solar System 3D Explorer

A simple, interactive, and visually appealing 3D visualization of our solar system built using the Three.js library. This project allows users to orbit and zoom around the Sun, planets, and moons, providing basic information on hover.

## ✨ Features

* **Realistic Scale:** Distances and sizes are scaled to fit a comfortable screen view, while maintaining planetary arrangement.
* **Orbital Mechanics:** Planets and their moons orbit and rotate around their parent bodies.
* **Asteroid & Kuiper Belts:** Includes visual representations of the asteroid belt and the distant Kuiper Belt objects.
* **User Interface:** A simple display panel shows information on the selected or hovered celestial body.
* **Camera Controls:** Uses OrbitControls for intuitive navigation (zoom, pan, rotate).
* **Reset View Button:** A dedicated button to instantly return the camera to the initial overview position.


## ⚙️ Dependencies

* [**Three.js (r128)**](https://threejs.org/): Core 3D library.
* [**OrbitControls.js**](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls): For camera interaction.
